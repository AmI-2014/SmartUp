          <h3><a name="" class="anchor" href=""><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Smart Butler</h3>

            <p>The Smart Butler project aims to create a system able to substitute a human butler in a domestic environment.</p>


          <h3><a name="" class="anchor" href=""><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why to choose it</h3>
    
            <p>The Smart Butler is..smart! It will be everywhere, ready to perform any task in the shortest time, but it will show up only when needed.
              <br>
              You will have an extra hand to manage your daily routine plus it will help you in many little things, relieving you from boring tasks and letting you enjoy your life with more energy!
           </p>
 
          <h3><a name="" class="anchor" href=""><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does it work</h3>

            <p>Based on vocal commands and users’ agenda, the Smart Butler will be able to recognize the activities that the user is performing or is going to thanks to a transparent network of sensors.</p>

          <h3><a name="" class="anchor" href=""><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What does it do</h3>

            <p>
            <ul type=”square”>
            <li>It will set properly the environment so that you can carry out your task in a comfortable way. You will never feel too hot or too cold neither the need to regulate ligths
            <li>Nobody will bother you with Skype calls or chat messages in a crucial moment because the Smart Butler will set automatically all your social’s status on ‘busy’ mode
            <li>You will receive record of every person that called you or come to see you while you were busy and everyone will know when you will be avaiable again to have a nice chat with them!
            <li>You won’t never stain your recipes again while cooking because Smart Butler will read them out loud for you!
            <li>It will help you remember everything you planned for the day.
            </ul>
            </p>
 
          <h3><a name="" class="anchor" href=""><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a> What we are going to implement</h3> 

          <p>Because we are very tight on time we are going to develop just two “functionalities” to show you the philosophy of this system.
            <br>
            The first one involves the kitchen environment. Saying some simple keywords the Smart Butler will guide you reading recipes while you are cooking (with the possibility to stop and restart it when you will be ready), it will remember you it’s time to turn off the oven or the burners and will play some music while you’re eating.    
            <br>
            The other concerns the training activity. When you will start to run on the tapis-roulant or to  work out with you’re athletic equipment the system will adjust the temperature in the room so that you won’t melt down. You will have the possibility to choose between listening to some music or followimg the lesson of a personal trainer even with a video. 
            <br>
            In both cases nobody will distract you from what you are doing because on your request the system will set all your social status on busy-mode. If someone will try to get in touch with you the system will remember it and tell when you will be done with your stuff.
